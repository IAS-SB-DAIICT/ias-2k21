          <h4 class="blue-text">Why join IEEE?</h4>
          <p class="black-text">IEEE appeared from the union of two engineering societies in the early sixties, the IRE (Institute of Radio Engineers) and the AIEE (American Institute of Electrical Engineers). The IEEE is essentially a society for Electrical and Computer Engineers, but it also welcomes Computer Scientists and Physicists. IEEE is what is known as a technical professional society. Every engineering branch has a technical professional society, Civil Engineering has ASCE (American Society of Civil Engineers), Mechanical Engineering has ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers).</p>
          <p style="color: black;">What distinguishes IEEE from this other societies is the fact that IEEE is international. There are IEEE chapters in every continent, and in almost every country, and in those countries where IEEE is not established it has links with the local engineering societies, such as the case with IKE (Institution of Electrical Engineers) in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. This makes IEEE the largest engineering society in the world.</p>

              <p>
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">IEEE IAS DAIICT Student Branch Chapter</span> proudly presents <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Blog-A-Thon</span>, a blog-writing competition as a part of the celebration of IAS DAIICT Day 2021. There are four themes :
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Mathematical equations that changed the world</b>
                <p>From Newton's Law of Gravity to the Black-Scholes model used by bankers to predict the markets, equations are everywhere and they are fundamental to everyday life.</p>
                <p>Equations make complex and tedious tasks simpler and faster, isn’t it?</p>
                <p>IEEE SB SB DAIICT gives you an opportunity to participate in our Blog-A-thon and share your ideas on how these mathematical equations have changed the world around us. </p>

                <b>Social Media: a double-edged sword</b>
                <p>How long has social media been around? What is social media used for?
                How does social media affect mental health? Does social media negatively impact wellbeing? 
                How are young people affected by social media?
                What are the positives of using social media? 
                Are social media platforms safe to use? 
                Can social media gauge public opinion on emerging issues? 
                Have they become the key platform for dialogue?
                Are we on our way toward a media democracy?</p>
                <p>Digitization has huge potential. IEEE SB SB DAIICT invites you to participate in our Blog-A-thon and share your thoughts about the role of social media as a double-edged sword.</p>

                <b>Impact of Covid-19 on Education Sector</b>
                <p>COVID-19 has affected a large number of students across 
                  the globe. The shutting down of schools and shifting traditional
                   classrooms to digital platforms has increased learning inequality
                    among children and pushed a large number of children out of school
                     due to the digital divide. The role of the budget in the current
                      situation and beyond the pandemic is crucial to ensure inclusive
                       education for all.</p>
                <p>IEEE SB SB DAIICT gives you an opportunity to participate in our 
                  Blog-A-thon and share your thoughts about the impact of Covid-19 on
                   the education sector of our country.</p>


                <b>Cryptocurrency in India: Present situation and future prospects</b>
                <p>“I am very excited about the prospect of using cryptocurrency, not just as a money equivalent, but using it as a way to earn something as a result of doing some type of work.”
                <h6 style="text-align: right;">– William Mougayar</h6></p>
                <p>We know that a cryptocurrency is a form of digital asset based on a 
                  network that is distributed across a large number of computers.
                  This decentralized structure allows them to exist outside the 
                  control of governments and central authorities.
                What are you waiting for? Let’s get started. Whether it’s your first
                blog or an experienced blogger, the only thing that matters is your 
                honest view of these topics.</p>

                      IEEE IAS DAIICT Student Branch Chapter organised a visit to Akshaya Patra Foundation on 27th October 2018. It is a non-profit organisation in India that runs school lunch programme across India. Akshaya Patra was established in 2000. It has its kitchens in Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Chattisgarh, and many places in India. It has the largest kitchen in Bangalore and second largest in Ahmedabad. Due to incapability of accomodating more students at a time in the kitchen area, only ten students were invited for the visit.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      We were warmly welcomed by the officials of Akshaya Patra Foundation. They gave us brief information about their organisation, their aim and how they have been constantly striving to achieve it. The tour was about to start before which we were given shoe and hair covers to wear before entering the area. The kitchen is structured in such a way to exploit te force of gravity. It has three floors where the dishes are cooked simultaneously. All the machines and vessels used in the kitchen are manufactured in India. They have aptly made use of the technology in the right spirit. The whole kitchen was very clean and well managed by sufficient workforce. Also, the nutrition value of the food is strictly taken care of. The whole process was explained very nicely by the officials who offered us some biscuits from the bakery.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      As the students from the technical domain, it was an incredible experience to watch such a simple process like cooking being carried out in such an inconceivably massive scale with full automation. They have truely exploited the boons of technology for such a noble cause. It was a great experience visiting Akshaya Patra Foundation. Everyone was greatful for this opportunity to know how the world's largest NGO-run Mid-Day Meal programme is carried out.

                  A <b>session on Git-GitHub</b> was organised by <b>IEEE IAS Student Branch Chapter DAIICT</b> on 30th January, 2021. As college campuses haven’t re-opened yet owing to the Covid-19, this session too, like the last few sessions was held online on the Webex platform.
                </p>
                <img src="images/git-github2021.png" alt="Git-GitHub Session Img" class="responsive-img" style="width:100% ;height: 500px">
                <p>
                  <b>Git</b> is a version control system that helps developers to maintain and develop their software in a much-organized manner. <b>GitHub</b> is a web-server and website where one can keep all the code and more than one person can collaborate and code on one project simultaneously.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Irrespective of specific domains, Git GitHub is a very fundamental thing for students especially of an ICT college like us and therefore this session was organised in order to make everyone, especially the freshers realize its value and help them get started with it. Moreover, this session also served as a stepping stone for the ones planning to get started with open source contributions and programs like GSoC, Outreachy, etc. because the contribution to open source is not possible without basic knowledge of Git Github.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This session was taken over by <b>Mr. Dushyant Pathak</b> who is a very good orator and is currently pursuing his final year of B.Tech in DAIICT itself. He is a skilled Full Stack Developer and is experienced in many other tools and technologies like MEAN, MERN, Electron, Android and Deep Learning. He also maintains a blog (<a href="https://dkprobes.tech/">dkprobes.tech</a>) on Data Structures and Algorithms where he explains various typical algorithms in his own lucid style. He has also interned as a tech analyst at Deutsche Bank and thus has industry-level experience too of these things.
                </p>

                <p>
                  It started with a brief introduction of Git-GitHub, some introductory commands and then since the session was hands-on, it was taken care that participants were able to follow what was going-on on the screen. The participants raised their queries in the chatbox whenever they got stuck while trying on their own and those queries were readily answered during the session itself. Thereafter, the session moved towards a bit advanced concepts like creating branches, merging them, stashing commits, commands for resetting and rebasing, etc. Concepts like forking an open-source repository and contributing to it by making a Pull request were also covered towards the end of the session.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Indeed, it was an engaging session where potential developers of DAIICT showed full enthusiasm and made the session a success! As a whole, this session also sparked an interest towards open source among the first yearites and motivated them to get started contributing to it.

                  IEEE IAS IAS DAIICT organized a Blog-A-Thon, a blog-writing competition from 12th June to 25th June 2020, as a part of the celebration of IAS DAIICT Day 2020. Due to the pandemic situation, the participants wrote the articles from home and despite this, we received over 50 entries from colleges all over India. The event was solely organized to cultivate blogging skills amongst the students from not only the engineering field but also other fields of study.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The participants were given three recent themes to write upon that is Role of technology in lockdown, Indian economy after Covid-19 outbreak and Virtual Events-opportunity, or a roadblock. The registration was free of cost and prizes worth 6K were given to the top three entries.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The competition was judged by three of the great writers and famous LinkedIn Influencers - Ms. Shruti Kaushik, Ms. Shreya Pattar, and Dr. Alka Parikh. The entries were judged based on originality, relevance, flow, appeal, and the quality of the content. All the submitted entries were very insightful and judges were highly impressed by them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Eventually, although it was our first experience to organize a virtual Blog-A-Thon, it was indeed very successful. We really look forward to organizing such events in the future.

IEEE IAS DA-IICT Student Branch Chapter organized a technical hands-on session on Git and Github on 4th April, 2018 in CEP 110, DA-IICT. The speaker of the session was Mr. Khushil Mistry, a third year B.Tech student of DA-IICT. The session witnessed nearly 120 students who displayed great enthusiasm and keenness the whole time. Mr. Khushil Mistry began by giving an introduction to Git and explained its need in the world of collaborative development and research. He emphasized that nearly all multinational companies use this software for effective code development and maintenance. According to him, knowing Git is one of the most sought after industrial skills in the recent times. He introduced students to some of the very basic commands like creating a directory and adding files in it, making commits and listing out all the previous commits. He explained the commands used to save different versions of a file, to revert back to previous versions and to move to a specific version of a file. The students also learnt the code to find difference between versions and to merge various versions. This can be useful when two developers working on the same software want to merge their code into one file.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			Throughout the session, IEEE IAS DA-IICT Student Branch Chapter executive committee constantly volunteered in helping the students with their doubts to make sure everyone was on the same page as the speaker. This ensured that the session ran smoothly. It was a proud moment for IEEE IAS DA-IICT Student Branch Chapter to see the students with contentful smiles at the end of the session.

                      IEEE IAS SB chapter DA-IICT organized a talk on ‘Where Engineering leads?’on 1st April 2016 at 5 pm in conference room, CEP. Mr.Hakimuddin Ali - Managing Director and BU Head - India, South Africa and Middle East, Caldreys Refractories Ltd. was the speaker for the evening.He was accompanied by Prof.Dr. Anil Roy and Mr. Gaurang Shah who supported IAS in organising the talk. The speaker emphasized on three major points - the need of quality experience to tackle the real world problems, having ‘EQ higher than average IQ’  and the third being ‘Invest in yourself’. The session ended with a few questions by our future engineers which he answered tactfully with his experience and knowledge. In this world where we hear ‘No’ and ‘Don’t Do’, he advised us to come out of it and do what you decide to, not listening to the negative storytellers.
